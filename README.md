# Lunchline

It's 12:00. Time for lunch. Where to go, though? There are only so many hours in the day, and lunch hour is the most sacred of hours. We realize lunch time is valuable, which is why we are happy to bring you Lunchline!

Lunchline is a crowdsourced, mobile-first designed app that lets you quickly take a peek at the restaurants around you and see what the wait time to get your favorite food is. Simply navigate to lunchline.herokuapp.com, and boom! A list of restaurants in your immediate area appears with a green light, yellow light, and red light. Green means no wait, yellow means your food may take a bit, and red means lunch at your own risk.

Lunchline is designed in Angular and ExpressJS. We designed it to be as simple as possible, so you can make a quick decision and enjoy your lunch time. So please, take a look at the site and enjoy!
